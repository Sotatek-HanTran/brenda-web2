		<h2>Brenda-Web Tutorial</h2>
		<p class="lead">
			This tutorial will demonstrate the process for setting up AWS, submitting jobs and monitoring their progress.
		</p>

		<p>
			This tool is built around the <a href="https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda" target="_blank">Brenda</a> project.  As such, a lot
			of additional information and history can be found in the readme of that project.  This documentation attempts to
			answer most of the questions users will have but in the likely case that something is missing, it is highly
			recommended to read the documentation from the <a href="https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda" target="_blank">Brenda</a> repository
			on Github as it will likely contain the answers.  In the event that answers are not provided here or in the Brenda
			repository, questions can also be submitted to the
			<a href="https://github.com/njeirath/brenda-web/issues" target="_blank">Brenda-Web repository</a> and all attempts will be
			made to provide you with an answer.
		</p>

		<p>
			We assume you already have an AWS account and, for the sake of this tutorial, that it is brand new with nothing
			configured.  If you have previously used Brenda, some of the steps may not be required.  In general, the tool
			and configurations will happily live along side any other unrelated AWS resources without issues.  If you'd like
			further isolation, AWS allows for the creation of linked accounts.  The configuration of linked accounts is beyond
			the scope of this tutorial but additional details can be found
			<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To completely understand what is happening in this tutorial, we recommend logging in to the AWS console and observing the
			changes being made and resources being utilized.
		</p>

		<p>
			To assist with managing files in S3 buckets, a number of tools are available for uploading/downloading files from your S3
			buckets.  For the sake of this tutorial we utilize the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>
			tool however any tool of choice can be leveraged, including the AWS web interface.

			<h3>Start Workers</h3>

			<p class="lead">
				The workers are the AWS EC2 instances that will perform the work of rendering the frames
			</p>

			<p>
				On boot the workers will copy the Blender project from the source bucket.  Once the machine is up and running,
				they will start pulling tasks from the work queue.  Upon completion of each task, the results will be
				posted to the destination S3 bucket.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Enter the ID of the AMI image you'd like to use.  Optionally you can click on the links below the
					select box to auto populate the ID of the selected AMI.
				</li>
				<li>
					Select whether to use spot or on demand instances.  On demand are charged at the static price set
					by Amazon whereas spot instances are bids for unused capacity.
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the size of the EC2 instance to be used.
					See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>
					for more information.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you selected to run spot instances, a field for <strong>Spot Price</strong> will be present.  Enter
					the amount you want to bid for the spare capacity of the instance size you selected.  The latest spot
					price for the instance size you chose will be shown below the text box for convenience.
				</li>
				<li>Specify how many instance you want to start up in the <strong>Instance Count</strong> field</li>
				<li>Optionally specify a SSH key if you need to log in to the workers for any reason</li>
				<li>Click the <strong>Request Instances</strong> button to send your request to AWS</li>
			</ol>

		</section>
		<section id="dashboard">
			<h3>Monitor Job Status</h3>

			<p>
				Simply click on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab at the top of the page to access the dashboard.  If you've
				started a job already, you should begin to see the details of the progress.  The dashboard panels will update
				periodically on their own.
			</p>

			<h4>Queues</h4>
			<p>
				This panel shows the various queues that have tasks being processed by workers.  Here you can see the current
				size of the queue, how many workers are pulling tasks from this queue, and some metrics estimating the task rate
				and time left to complete the job.
			</p>

			<h4>Workers</h4>
			<p>
				This panel will have a row for each EC2 instance that was started by Brenda-Web.  It will include details about
				the instance itself and its current state along with metrics such as uptime, task rate and CPU load.
			</p>

			<h4>Buckets</h4>
			<p>
				If this is the first time you've used the specified destination bucket with this tool, you'll likely get an
				error.  Try clicking on the <strong>fix it</strong> link in the error message and follow the instructions to
				attempt to remedy the issue.
			</p>

			<p>
				The buckets panel will display the files that are currently in the bucket specified.  These represent completed
				tasks.  Clicking on the name of a file will open an in browser view of the rendered frame, you can use the
				left/right arrow keys or the buttons at the top to step between frames.  Clicking on the
				<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download" hide-aria="true"></span> icon next to the file name will download
				that single file.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="ebsSource">
			<h3>EBS Sources</h3>

			<p>
				When a worker is started, the first thing it will do is copy the Blender project from S3 to the EC2 instance.
				In the case that your Blender project is large, this can take some time before the rendering process will be
				able to start.  In this case, an alternative is to place your project files on an EBS volume and use a snapshot
				to distribute the data to the workers.  The <a href="https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda" target="_blank">Brenda</a>
				Project readme has an in depth write up on how this works with Brenda so the details will be omitted from here
				but we'll cover the high level steps.  Note: Brenda supports mounting multiple EBS volumes to the same instance
				however, due to changes in how AWS mounts volumes, Brenda-Web currently only supports mounting a single EBS volume.
			</p>

			<h4>Setup Snapshot</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Use the AWS web console to spin up an EC2 instance, usually a <strong>t2.micro</strong> instance is sufficient</li>
				<li>Once it is ready, create an EBS volume large enough to be able to contain your project files</li>
				<li>Attach the volume to your instance</li>
				<li>SSH into your instance and mount the volume to a directory of your choosing</li>
				<li>
					Use any method you desire to copy your project files to the folder where the volume is mounted.  NOTE: it is
					important to place your .blend file at the root of this folder as this is where Brenda will look for it on the workers.
				</li>
				<li>Once your project is coppied, you can shut down your instance</li>
				<li>Use the AWS web console to locate your volume and select it</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Actions --> Create Snapshot</strong> to start the snapshot process</li>
				<li>Once the snapshot is created, it will be assigned an id that looks like <strong>snap-xxxxxxxx</strong></li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Using the Snapshot as the Project Source</h4>
			<p>
				Setting the snapshot as the project source is as simple as entering the source as an EBS style URL.  This will
				look something like <code>ebs://snap-xxxxxxxx</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				If for example your snapshot had ID <code>snap-abcd1234</code>, the proper URL would be <code>ebs://snap-abcd1234</code>
			</p>

			<p>
				When the worker is started, a volume will be created from the snapshot and be attached to the instance.  Brenda
				will use this as the project and begin executing tasks against it as usual.
			</p>

		<section id="customAmi">
			<h3>Create a Custom AMI</h3>
			<p class="lead">
				AMIs are the machine images, with software preinstalled, that are used to launch instances of workers
			</p>

			<p>
				There are a few reasons you may want to create your own custom AMI such as needing an updated or custom version
				of Blender on your workers.  Whatever the reason, this section will explain how to build your instance, image it
				and optionally make it public for others to use.  Since this is considered an "advanced" topic, we'll assume the
				reader is familiar with AWS and in particular EC2 instances, volumes, snapshots, and images.  Additionally, these
				steps were used to setup an AMI based on Ubuntu 14.04, if using a different version, make the appropriate adjustments.
			</p>

			<h4>Build Instance</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by opening the AWS web console and navigate to EC2</li>
				<li>Choose to launch an instance</li>
				<li>Select an image to start from, typically a flavor or Ubuntu</li>
				<li>Select an instance type, <strong>t2.micro</strong> should be sufficient for the following steps</li>
				<li>Follow through the rest of the steps with appropriate settings</li>
				<li>Once the instance is created and running, SSH into it</li>
				<li>
					Install blender and the various other dependencies using something like the following:
					<pre>
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install -y blender python-pip gcc python-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev git unzip
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Optional</strong>: The above commands will install Blender and its dependencies.  In case you want to
					download a different verion or build your own the following commands will remove the version that was installed
					(leaving the dependencies alone) and, in this example, dowload version 2.77a and install it:
					<pre>
apt-get remove -y blender

wget http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/blender/release/Blender2.77/blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2
bunzip2 -d blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2
cd /opt/
tar xvf /home/ubuntu/blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar
ln -s /opt/blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64/blender /usr/bin/blender
cd /home/ubuntu
rm blender-2.77a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					Install boto, s3cmd, and brenda:
					<pre>
pip install -U boto
pip install -U s3cmd

git clone http://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda.git
cd brenda
python setup.py install
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Optional (but recommended)</strong>: If you plan to make the AMI public, it is a VERY good idea to remove
					any keys and history from the instance first (NOTE: only do this right before you're ready to image the machine
					as once you remove your keys you will no longer be able to SSH into the instance):
					<pre>
rm -rf /root/.bash_history /home/ubuntu/.bash_history
rm -rf /root/.cache /home/ubuntu/.sudo_as_admin_successful /home/ubuntu/.cache /var/log/auth.log /var/log/lastlog
rm -rf /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.bak /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys.bak
					</pre>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				At this point the instance should be setup with Blender, and Brenda and their dependencies.  To confirm Blender is
				working, you may optionally run <code>blender -v</code> which should display the version of Blender.
			</p>

			<h4>Create the Image</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the AWS web console, navigate to EC2, find your running and configured instance and select it</li>
				<li>Select <strong>Actions --> Image --> Create Image</strong></li>
				<li>
					Fill in the required details (NOTE: make sure the <strong>Delete on Termination</strong> checkbox is selected
					to ensure volumes are not left in your AWS account as they will incur charges)
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The image creation process may take some time to complete, the status can be followed under the <strong>AMIs</strong>
				section of EC2.
			</p>

			<h4>Publish AMI</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click to select the AMI in the AWS web console</li>
				<li>Click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab and select <strong>Edit</strong></li>
				<li>Click <strong>Public</strong></li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				After some time, it should appear in the list of community AMIs.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Optional:</strong> If you'd like your AMI to appear in the list of preset AMIs within Brenda-Web there are
				a couple options to choose from:

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Recommended:</strong> Clone the
						<a href="https://github.com/njeirath/brenda-web" target="_blank">Brenda-Web Git repo</a>, edit the json file
						located at <code>assets/amiList.json</code> with the necessary details, and submit a PR.  Once the PR is reviewed
						and merged, your AMI will appear in the list of preset AMIs list on the site.
					</li>
					<li>
						The other option is to submit a ticket under the Github project requesting your AMI be added with the necessary
						details included.  This route will take longer as the ticket will have to be pulled and the code added.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Refer to the <a du-smooth-scroll="nginxPath">Nginx Path</a> help section for information on what the <code>nginxPath</code> property in
				<code>assets/amiList.json</code> should be set to.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="nginxPath">
			<h3>Nginx Path</h3>
			<div ng-include="'tutorial/nginxPath.partial.html'"></div>
			<p>
				If creating your own AMI and you want to validate this setting:
				<ol>
					<li>Use your AMI to start up an AWS instance</li>
					<li>Once it is running, SSH into your instance</li>
					<li>Install Nginx using <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code></li>
					<li>Once installed, open <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code></li>
					<li>Look for a property called <code>root</code>, the value will be the location you should use for the Nginx path</li>
					<li>Shut down your instance and use Blender-Web to start up a worker with your AMI and the appropriate Nginx path</li>
					<li>Once it starts up, if you see the status of your worker in the dashboard, the path was correct</li>
				</ol>
